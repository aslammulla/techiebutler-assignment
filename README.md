CRUD operations on the employee  in-memory store:

- `CreateEmployee`: Adds a new employee to the database or store.

- `GetEmployeeByID`: Retrieves an employee from the database or store by ID.

- `UpdateEmployee`: Updates the details of an existing employee.

- `DeleteEmployee`: Deletes an employee from the database or store by ID

Unit tests to cover the CRUD operations and ensure the correctness of the implementation.
